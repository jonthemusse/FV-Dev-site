# Site structure

## Homepage
The site is skitsofrenic in its contents. Hydro is only interesting locally, which would imp√∂y that committing a whole site section to it in all languages is overkill. Material-wise, this is more than a blog post, and incorrect use of white papers. I need a _project structure_ in addition to posts, and white papaers.

## docs 
need directly to reside on a subdomain, and depending on the willingness of peers, run it as a separate repo, or online wiki. Latter will require VPS services. Money.

## projects
Assuming at this point that every individual run approaching zero series will be separated as their individual projects. OTOH, shit should be omore abstracted. We either have

1. FV01 - Original proto
2. FV02 - Qvidja container 
3. FV03 - Oxygen gasifier

or

* Oxygen enriched syngas
* Pressure tight integrated backdraft gasifiers
* filter tech
